## Oleh Yukhymenko, a passionate gamer and Unity Developer

I have always had a passion for languages and video games. Working as a translator for many years, I realized that I reached my limit in this area. So, I decided to pursue the other passion of mine – gaming and game development. The pandemic made it possible to study hard and develop the necessary skills. I built [my first simple mobile game](https://github.com/Jukol/Fifteen), which you can [find on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.OlehYukhymenko.Fifteen). Building the game, I had an opportunity to apply my skills in C# and OOP I had learned in various free and paid online courses. Another pet project of mine — [a space shooter](https://github.com/Jukol/Space_Shooter/tree/master). In May, 2021, joined a professional development team in a gamedev company.
